"""Average handle time (AHT) per (dow, hour), from answered calls only.

    estimate_aht(conn, halflife_days=365) -> {(dow, hour): agent_sec}

Exponentially weighted mean: a call `age` days before the newest call in
the table gets weight 0.5 ** (age / halflife_days), so last year's calls
count about half as much as this year's. Cells with too few answered calls
fall back to the global weighted mean. No ML here.

Keys cover every (dow 1..7, hour 0..23) so callers never miss a lookup.
Connection comes from $V4W_DATABASE_URL (same pattern as db/load_calls.py).
